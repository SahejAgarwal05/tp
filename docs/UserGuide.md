# CEG StudyBuddy User Guide

## Introduction

**CEGStudyBuddy** is a desktop application that tracks and plans university courses efficiently for NUS Computer Engineering students who want a structured academic roadmap.  
It helps to optimise workload, ensure graduation requirements, and keep students organised with ease, while managing multiple scenarios and possible schedules in their academic journey.

This application is optimised for a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.  
If you are a fast typer, you can plan and track your courses faster than NUSMods and boost you CLI skills at the same tim e!

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17** installed on your computer.  
   You may download Java 17 from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).

   - **Windows Users**: Any Windows installer will work, but the Windows x64 Installer is recommended.
   - **Mac Users**: Use the macOS x64 DMG Installer if you have an Intel CPU, or the macOS Arm 64 DMG Installer for Apple M-series CPUs.
   - **Linux Users**: Use the Debian Package for Debian-based distros (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) or the RPM Package for Red Hat-based distros (Fedora, CentOS).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file for CEGStudyBuddy [here](http://link.to/cegstudybuddy).

3. Place the `.jar` file in a desired folder.  
   This folder will act as the working directory for the application.

4. Open your terminal in that folder:
   - On **Windows**: Right-click in the folder and select *Open in Terminal*.
   - On **Mac/Linux**: Use `cd` to navigate to the folder in Terminal.

5. Run the application:
   ```
java -jar cegstudybuddy.jar


6. Start typing commands and hit `Enter`.

Refer to the **Features** section below for all available commands.

## Features

### Notes about Course Plans
At any time, in CEGStudyBuddy, you will be working on a plan, so in the start you will be asked to create a new plan or work on a pre-existing plan.
You can save multiple course plans and switch between them (see Switch Plan Command below).

Note that the current version of CEGStudyBuddy does not automatically save your course plan. Please remember to run the save command before you exit.


### Notes about the Command Format

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.  
  Example: `add c/CS2113`
- Square brackets `[]` indicate optional fields.  
  Example: `edit c/CODE [t/TITLE]`
- Extra parameters in commands that don’t require them (e.g. `list`) will be ignored.

This command does not take any parameters.

**Format:**
```
delete_plan
```

---

### Exit Program: `exit`
Exits the program.
